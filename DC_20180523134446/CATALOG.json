Every second Wednesday, Burhan and company (often Angelica and Tamara), measured the stem dimensions of all 12 trees.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of the experiment, there were multiple potted plants in each chamber, so there were multiple pots per chamber. After the trees were planted in the ground, diameter was measured 15-cm-height, 30-cm-height, and then at ~30-cm increments up the stem of each tree. The 15-cm and 30-cm measurements were abandoned after the plastic floors were installed. The diameter measurement at 65-cm-height may be particularly useful, as it is close to \"basal diameter\" and it was measured throughout the entire experiment. A few trees forked late in the experiment, and thus have multiple stems.\r\n\r\nVariables:\r\n\"chamber\" : \"C01\", \"C02\", etc.\r\n\"T_treatment\": the long term temperature treatment: \"ambient\" or \"elevated\"\r\n\"Pot_No\" : the pot number. Note that there were multiple pots per chamber early in the experiment.\r\n\"Stem\": the stem number. Often NA, but has a value for trees that forked.\r\n\"Date\": the date, in YYYY-MM-DD\r\n\"Stem_length_cm\" : the length of the stem (cm). Approximately the same as \"height\".\r\n\"first_order_Brs\": the number of 1st order branches\r\n\"Lvs_whole_tree\": the number of leaves counted for the entire tree. Note this was only done twice, for very small trees. Another complete leaf count was done for larger trees later in the experiment: these data are not in this file.\r\n\"Diam_15cm\" , etc. The rest of the variables are diameter measurements (mm).

These measurements were done by Rosana Lopez along with Chris Blackman and Sebastian Pfaustch during the heatwave portion of the experiment.\r\nOne shoot per tree was harvested in the early morning before and just after the heatwave to assess native embolism (i.e., the loss of hydraulic conductivity). One hour before collection, shoots were covered with black plastic bags and sprayed with water to stop transpiration and allow water potential to equilibrate. Shoots were harvested under water and transported to the laboratory with their cut ends immersed in water and their leaves covered to release tension. Two 5 cm long segments were excised under water from terminal parts of each shoot and connected to a flow meter (Bronkhorst High-Tech B.V., Ruurlo, the Netherlands). Hydraulic conductance was measured at low pressure (\u2264 2 kPa) before (kini) and after (kfin) flushing with ultrapure, degassed 2 mmol KCl solution at high pressure for 30 min. Percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) was calculated as: PLC = 100 - kini / kfin * 100. Actual hydraulic conductance values based on ki and kf were calculated using the measured pressure gradient, sample length, and xylem area. The values of kini and kfin are the raw values of the flowmeter and have units of %; these should not be used for comparison between samples- they are only valid to calculate the plc because the pressure gradient in each sample was maintained at a common value.\r\n\r\nVariables:\r\nchamber: \"C01\", \"C02\", etc\r\nT_treatment: the long term temperature treatment- (\"ambient\" or \"elevated\")\r\nHW_treatment: the heatwave treatment (\"control\" vs. \"heatwave\")\r\nDate: the date in YYYY-MM-DD\r\nbranch: the subreplicate number (1 or 2)\r\nkini: the initial flow measurement (%; raw off instrument)\r\nkfin: the final flow measurement (%; raw off instrument)\r\nplc: the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity in native state relative to rehydrated state (%)\r\nKsi: the hydraulic conductivity in the native state (Kg m-1 s-1 MPa-1)\r\nKSf: the hydraulic conductivity in the rehydrated state (Kg m-1 s-1 MPa-1)\r\n\r\nFile prepared by John Drake",

These data were collected by Chris Blackman et al. during the heatwave.\r\nLeaf hydraulic conductivity (Kleaf) was measured using the kinetics of leaf water potential relaxation upon leaf rehydration. One 30-40 cm branch per tree before, during and after the heatwave were collected early in the morning and transported to the laboratory in black plastic bags. Branches were cut to a length sufficient to prevent emboli from extending into the petioles of the leaves. Once in the lab, branches were allowed to desiccate slowly for up to 48 hrs, before being carefully bagged to prevent water loss and equilibrate water potential throughout the branch. Initial \u03a8L was determined by measuring one leaf neighbouring the sample leaves in a pressure chamber. Two sample leaves were then cut under water and allowed to rehydrate for 15-20 s and final leaf water potential was measured with the pressure chamber. Kleaf was calculated as Kleaf = Cleaf ln[\u03a8o/\u03a8f]/t where \u03a8o = initial leaf water potential (MPa); \u03a8f = final leaf water potential (MPa); t = duration of rehydration (s); Cleaf = leaf capacitance (mmol m-2 MPa-1).\r\n\r\nThe method is further described by:\r\nBrodribb TJ & Holbrook NM.

            "description": "Daily estimates of total crown leaf area and mass for trees in the fourth whole-tree chamber experiment with Eucalyptus parramattensis (WTC4). \r\n\r\nThese values were estimated via the approach outlined in Drake et al. (2016) New Phytologist and Barton et al. (2012) Global Change Biology. Total whole-crown leaf area was estimated three times during the experiment. (1) There was a complete leaf count performed on 2016-04-07, along with measurements of average leaf size. Total leaf area was calculated as the product of leaf number and leaf size. (2) There was an incomplete leaf count performed again on 2016-08-25, where all leaves on a subset of branches was counted. Adam Tjoelker also counted all leaves on C08 and C09 on 2016-08-26. We developed a branch allometry to predict branch-scale leaf area from branch length and relative insertion point. This branch allometry was used to predict the total leaf area of each tree crown; these estimates were off by ~10% relative to Adam\u2019s compete count. (3) Total crown leaf area was estimated at the final harvest as total leaf mass multiplied by specific leaf area for each crown third.\r\n\r\nThese three estimates of total crown leaf area were combined with litterfall estimates to create a relationship between log10(height) and log10(cumulative leaf area production). Trees had different intercepts, but equivalent slopes. This relationship was used to calculate the cumulative leaf area produced on each date when tree height was measured directly, from which standing leaf area was calculated by subtracting the cumulative sum of litterfall measured prior to the date in question. These estimates were then linearly interpolated through time to produce these estimates of total leaf area at a daily scale. Leaf mass was calculated from leaf area using the average SLA values obtained at the final harvest.\r\n\r\nFile prepared by John Drake \r\n\r\nchamber : the whole-tree chamber ID (\"C01\", \"C02\", etc). \r\nDate : The date, in YYYY-MM-DD \r\nleaf_area : the total area (m2) of all leaves in each tree crown\r\nSLA: the specific leaf area measured at the final harvest, averaged across canopy layers (cm2 g-1)\r\nleaf_mass: the total mass (g) of all leaves in each tree crown\r\n",

            "description": "Canopy harvest data from the fourth whole-tree chamber experiment (WTC4) with Eucalyptus parramattensis. On the first day of the harvest (23 Nov 2016), branches were removed from each tree by cutting flush to the stem insertion point and aggregated into three canopy layers (lower third, middle third, and upper third). For each aggregate branch sample (e.g., the lower third canopy layer of C02), all leaves were manually removed and composited. Petioles stayed with the leaves, not the branches. \r\n\r\nLeaves. The aggregate pile of leaves for each canopy layer was mixed by hand, and a random subsample of 100 leaves was selected (most frequently exactly 100, occasionally 99 or 101). The total leaf area of this subsample was measured with a licor rotary leaf area meter, and the subsample was further measured for fresh mass and dry mass. Specific leaf area (SLA) was calculated from these measurements. The leaves remaining (i.e., the leaves not in the 100-leaf subsample) were also measured for fresh and dry mass. Total leaf dry mass for the layer was calculated as the sum of the dry masses for the bulk leaf sample and the 100-leaf subsample. Total leaf area for the layer was calculated as total leaf dry mass multiplied by SLA and divided by 10000 to covert to square meters of leaf area.\r\n\r\nBranches. All branches of each canopy layer were composited after leaf removal. John Drake removed a single branch per sample for the lower and middle third of each canopy for measurements of branch respiration rate. This branch was dried and weighed separately. The remaining pile of branches was measured for fresh and dry mass. Total branch dry mass was calculated as the sum of the respiration branch dry mass and the bulk branch sample dry mass.\r\n\r\nVariables:\r\nchamber : the whole-tree chamber ID (\"C01\", \"C02\", etc) \r\nlayer : the layer height (\"low\", \"mid\", or \"top\") , refering to the lower third, the middle third, or the upper third \r\ntotal_leaf_DM : the total dry mass of leaves in that canopy layer (g).

            "description": "Coarse root harvest data from the fourth whole-tree chamber experiment (WTC4) with Eucalyptus parramattensis. The entire soil volume was excavated for each tree between 28 Nov to 13 Dec 2016. Chambers were excavated from the soil surface down to the hardlayer of cemented manganese. The depth of this manganese layer varied across chambers from a minimum of 62.8 cm to 105.8 cm. Excavation was done by hand using mattocks and shovels. Soil was shoveled out of the chambers onto a moving treadmill that transported the soil onto a coarse sieve, where roots were picked by an operator. Note that this was a lot of manual work, as several tons of soil had to be moved by hand. Thus on most days, only a single chamber was excavated per day.\r\n\r\nRoots were subsequently separated into diameter size classes (0-2mm, 2-10mm, >10mm, and the root bole), washed, dried, and weighed. Note that we did not trust the data for the 0-2mm size class- we think we missed a large fraction of these small roots. Thus, use the fine root data from the soil coring to estimate fine root mass for this experiment (WTC_TEMP-PARRA_CM_BIOMASS-ROOT-CORES_20161125-20161128_L1.csv).\r\n\r\n\r\nVariables:\r\nchamber : the whole-tree chamber ID (\"C01\", \"C02\", etc) \r\nCR_DM_2to10 : the total coarse root dry mass of roots from 2-10mm in diameter (g)\r\nCR_DM_10plus: the total coarse root dry mass of roots greater than 10mm in diameter, excluding the root bole (g)\r\nCR_DM_bole: the total coarse root dry mass of the root bole (g)\r\nCR_DM_total: the total coarse root dry mass (g).
